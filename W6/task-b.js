// Create 3 seperate tables that can be switched via ui switch button without a page reload
// Each table should represent some data from the json place holder api ( The data and url for each table is your choice)
// The switch between each table should re-call/access the json api/server each time (update data)

// For each table provide a button which based on any column of your choosing
// re-orders the table by either alpha or numeric order. Buttons such as 'a-z' and
// 'ascending - descending' should be in play.
